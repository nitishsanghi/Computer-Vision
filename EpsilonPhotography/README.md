# Epsilon Photography
This project uses computer vision concepts to create an extended depth of field photograph using a sequence of photographs of the same subject area but taken at different depths of field. The goal is to construct a composite image with extended depth of field by focus stacking. Computer vision concepts of grayscale conversion, image gradients, laplacian, masking, image frame alignment using motion models, etc are used to accomplish the project goal. For details please refer to the report.pdf file in the repository. The resulting artifact is below.
