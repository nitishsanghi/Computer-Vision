# Behavioral Cloning using Deep Learning Neural Net

In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks are used to clone driving behavior. A model was trained, validated and tested using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle. A simulator was used to steer a car around a track for data collection. The image data and steering angles were used to train a neural network and then used this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.
