# Traffic Sign Classification using Neural Net
A self driving car to navigate safely will have identify and interpret road signs for the driving algorithm to make decisions. I have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network to classify various road signs encountered on a road. In this project a Convolutional Neural Network is trained using image data set of 42 common road signs. Before the neural network is trained, it is important to explore the data to understand how the data needs to be processed to be put through the neural network pipeline. Datasets need to be balanced for the neural network to train and classify objects with high accuracy. Details regarding the data exploration and pipeline are below.
