# Video Textures

This project uses digital imaging concepts to create a video texture from a finite length video. Video Textures are derived from video by changing the order in which the recorded frames are played. The goal is to construct a video artifact that plays continuously even though it is composed of frames derived from a finite length video. For details please refer to the report.pdf file in the repository. The examples of resulting artifacts are below.
