# High Dynamic Range (HDR) Image Composition

This project uses vision concepts to create a High Dynamic Range image composition from a sequence of photographs of the same subject with vast variance in exposure time. The goal is to construct a composite image which has greater dynamic range of luminosity than possible with standard digital imaging. Fundamental concepts of camera response curve, image radiance map, and tone mapping. For details please refer to the report.pdf file in the repository. The gifs below are composed of the sequence of images used for HDR and the images of the right are the resulting tone mapped HDR images.
