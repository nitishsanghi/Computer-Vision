# Panaromic Images
This project uses computer vision concepts to create a panaromic image from a sequence of photographs with small lateral spatial differentials. The goal is to construct a composite image by stitching together images. Computer vision concepts of feature detection and matching, image homography, bounding corners from homographs, image warping for alignment of consecutive images, and blending functions to blend consecutive images. For details please refer to the report.pdf file in the repository. The resulting artifact is below.

The gif below illustrates the raw sequence of images and the resultant panaromic image.
