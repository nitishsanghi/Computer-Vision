# Advance Lane Lines

Taking lane finding to the next level, I have implemented computer vision techniques to identify lane lines with curvature and shadows on a road. The python pipeline implemented uses some advanced computer vision techniques to identify lane lines, road curvature, shadows, etc on a road. Camera distortion is also accounted for in this pipeline Frames from the video are individually processed by the pipeline to find the lane lines. Once each frame has been processed they are stitched back together in to a video. The pipeline has been been detailed below with sample frames shown as they are processed. The pipeline has been been detailed below with sample frames shown as they are processed and the resulting lane lines in the gif next to it.
