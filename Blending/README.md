# Image Blending

This project uses computer vision concepts to create a blended image out of two random images by "feathering" together the images. The goal is to take a feature/subject from one image and "blend" it into the other image so that it appears to be part of it. Computer vision concepts of image downsampling, image upsampling, gradient pyramid, and laplacian pyramid are used to accomplish the project goal. For details please refer to the report.pdf file in the repository. The resulting artifact is below.
