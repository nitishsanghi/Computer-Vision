# Finding Lane Lines
Identifying lanes on the road is one of the basic functionality a self-driving car needs to be able to safely drive on the free-way or city roads. In this project a python pipeline has been implemented using simple computer vision techniques to identify lane lines on a road. Three different lane lines have been identified: Solid Yellow, Solid White and Dashed White. Frames from the video are individually processed by the pipeline to find the lane lines in each image. Once each frame has been processed they are stitched back together in to a video. The pipeline has been been detailed below with sample frames shown as they are processed and the resulting lane lines in the gif next to it.
