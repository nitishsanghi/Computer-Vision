# Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing

This replication project investigates and implements a content-aware image resizing algorithm which uses a simple image operator called seam carving. Seam carving can be used for both reduction and expansion of images. To accomplish the tasks of the project, a thorough review of the paper was conducted to understand the seam carving algorithm presented. The report (available in the respository) documents implementation of seam carving algorithm for seam removal and image enlargement. A brief description of the algorithm is presented along with replicated results. These replicated results have been compared for similar- ities and differences. Further, due to certain ambiguities present in the paper [1], assumptions made and difficulties are also discussed. The image on the left below is the original image and the image on the right is a seam carved resized image.
