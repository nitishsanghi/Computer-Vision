# Exposure Fusion: Low Dynamic Range (LDR) Imaging

This project uses vision concepts to create a Low Dynamic Range image composition from a sequence of photographs of the same subject with different exposure times. The goal is to construct a composite image which has greater dynamic range of luminosity than possible with standard digital imaging. Fundamental concepts of imaging: constrast, luminosity, and saturation form the foundation behind the idea of exposure fusion. The gif below is composed of the sequence of images used for exposure fusion and the image of the right are the resulting LDR image.
